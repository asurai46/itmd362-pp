Explanation of your color choices: When I think of gaming laptop, three colors come to mind: red, green, and blue. I went with blue because it
is my favorite color. I also chose black for the background as it looks good with blue. This also kind of give off a feel similar to lots of
gaming laptops that are black with led backlight for the keyboard area and the company's logo.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.
