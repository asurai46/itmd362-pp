# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Explanation of your color choices: When I think of gaming laptop, three colors come to mind: red, green, and blue. I went with blue because it
is my favorite color. I also chose black for the background as it looks good with blue. This also kind of give off a feel similar to lots of
gaming laptops that are black with led backlight for the keyboard area and the company's logo.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Explanation of your color choices: When I think of natural and organic foods, the color green comes to mind. This is because green is the color of
the leafy vegetables that our parents made us eat so we can get big and strong, as well as being healthy.

* A complementary palette for a banking website.

Explanation of your color choices: I went with a lighter/sky blue color for a banking website because it is easy to look at.
To go with this would be the color white for the background and they grey could be for the nav bar.

* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.
